    <p>Before visiting Archer Malmo we setup our basic layout of our websites. It took a little help from www.w3schools.com to obtain all the features we wantedt to us but it was accomplished. It was tedious getting all of my teachers' attention so that they could sign my field trip slip,but eventually we were in the clear. EXCEPT FOR OLIVIA WHO GOT SUSPENDED THE DAY BEFORE AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY BUDDY !The night before Mrs. Sinclair asked us for a list of questions to have ready to ask our speaker, Gabe.</p>

    <p>Arriving at Archer Malmo we were dropped off in the alley too far from our destination ! CAUSE IT WAS CHILLLLLLLLY ! We took groups of five to ten up in the elevator at a time where would listen to the overview and job descriptions within Archer Malmo. Gabe, explained to us the many different jobs they have and how many it takes for a single project. There are several steps including: creating a concept, sketching, design, development, reviewing the project with customers, editing, and finishing the product. The most interesting part to me is that they hire many of their interns and a few of thir workers dont even have a college degree! We also visited the video production room , which also does Yoga on Tuesdays for anyone who needs to cleanse their spirits, where me and Aaron basically had a photo shoot. After our modeling session we FINALLY got food.</p>

    <p>The line we formed in Cook Out resulted in alot of dirty looks from customers and workers. One man said rudely, "What'd they do bring a field trip here?" I said , "Yes, we sure did." Sorry sir this isn't under your control! Aaron and I got a window seat and I'm pretty sure I told him my entire life story cause I talked his head off. He's a really good listener and unlike most guys , I couldn't tell if he didn't care. As much as I know how behind I can be after missing Mrs. Steele's class ,  I was not ready to go back ! NOW WHEN WE GOT ON THIS BUS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL THIS BUS DRIVER...... I'm glad I didn't refill my tea but I was upset I had to throw it out, but I still saved a chicken quesidilla for my boyfriend cause I know he had to stay afterschool with me for a meeting and choir practice. I dropped that off to him in his classroom and returned to class.</p>
